Test for GraalVM Native Image supporting Java Modules + ServiceLoader,
using the module-info.java to define the services and usages, rather than
using META-INF/services/* to define them.

============================================================================

This has been tested to work on an old variant of GraalVM CE 11, and not
working on the current latest Oracle GraalVM 21 (as of 24/09/2024).

ServiceLoader support for module-info has been broken.

============================================================================

Build with `mvn package` and then run `build-native-image` to make a test program.
Modify the script if you want to change the version of native-image you are testing against.

bash script was provided for convenience, was never tested
